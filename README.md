# Daymet-to-data
A shiny app that allows users to access interpolated historical weather data

## What is Daymet?

Daymet is software that takes inputs from multiple ground-based weather stations and estimates daily maximum and minimum temperature, precipitation, humidity and radiation for locations outside the coverage area of any one particular weather station. This gives researchers interested in remote locations access to important meteorological data dating back to 1980.

## The App
This App provides an easy to use point-and-click interface that users with no prior programming knowledge can easily navigate. Users are given the option to identify locations with either latitude and longitude, or zip code. Additionally, all the data from each location is compiled into a single csv file for download.
